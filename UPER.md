<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* I am being asked to create a user web interface that allows them to view an online store's wares and choose what they wish to purchase.

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*My first step for this project will be to plan out what the pages will look like on figma.
*I will make a website for an online clothing store.
*I will create a home page that also displays the current inventory. This page will also have search functionality.
*When an inventory item is selected, it will take the user to another page that allows them to add it to their order.
*Then I will have a checkout page where everyone can verify their order and proceed with payment.
*I will create a json file for my objects.
*I will make the website responsive for desktop and mobile.
*I will build the page using react bootstrap from the start.
-I will use cards for each inventory item.
